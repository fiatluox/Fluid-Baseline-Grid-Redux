          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
          you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
          don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
          case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
          much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
          ass.

          Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make
          it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin'
          house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit
          to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker,
          know what I'm sayin'?

          Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
          called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make
          shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
          going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
          television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
          of the ones that became nothing.

          Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
          bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
          That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact
          same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in
          our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
          you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
          a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
          murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
          don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
          seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
          took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow
          that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it
          doesn't hold a candle to man.

          Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
          clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
          Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
          mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? That's
          what you see at a toy store.
